# BOT_IO

## Description

BOT.IO is my Flatiron Bootcamp capstone project. The goal was to really demonstrate my frontend and backend skills I have pickedup over the course of the 15 weeks at Flatiron Bootcamp. I had a lot fun with this project and really played with it. It is also mobile responsive! I implemented bot and user avatar svg images from DiceBear's API and incorporated a unique user experience by leveraging a lot of visuals and audio to really engage the user and a clean UI design for a more intuitive navigation.
