# BOT_IO

## Description

BOT.IO is my Flatiron Bootcamp capstone project. The goal was to really show what I have learned over the course of the 15 week program. I had fun with this project, really focusing on front-end unique user experience and a clean simple user interface. It is also mobile responsive! I implemented Bot and Avatar svg images from DiceBear's API and incorporated a fun UI design to go along with the images. -Built with React, Rails and Material UI.
